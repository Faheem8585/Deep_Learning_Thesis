# ct_image_analysis


This repository includes code for automated analysis of CT images of Raney Nickel-coated electrodes. The focus is on detecting and quantifying cracks, coating coverage, uncovered areas, and delaminations. These automated processes streamline the analysis of large datasets and aid in understanding material degradation for green hydrogen production.

# Purpose:

Automate the detection of cracks and delamination.
Quantify surface coverage and degradation patterns.
# Tools Used:

**OpenCV**: Image processing and edge detection.
**scikit-image**: Machine learning and feature extraction.
**ImageJ (Fiji)**: Visualization and manual verification.
